2276,2276,30355.0,Braunschweig,Ecuador,,,"Module objective - The national system of Quality Infrastructure is strengthened for the demand of services in the area of energy efficiency. Core problem - Many of the voluntary and mandatory energy efficiency standards cannot be tested in the country because the relevant testing services are not available. Due to the insufficient testing of the quality of products with reference to established standards it is impossible to test and label whether products imported or produced in Ecuador comply with national standards. Thus, products of higher quality, which are more efficient but may be more expensive to purchase, are unable to compete against cheap products. Target groups - The target group are consumers of energy, especially private households, and users of quality infrastructure services in the area of energy efficiency, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. National manufacturers of electrical household appliances also benefit from the services, as they can make use of improved services for conformity assessment in the field of energy efficiency. The national institutions of the quality infrastructure, in particular the National Metrology Institute INEN, calibration and testing laboratories, the accreditation body SAE and conformity assessment bodies serve as intermediaries. Methodological approach (including instruments) - The methodological approach consists of the project coordination in Braunschweig and the assignment of an intermittent short-term expert with international expertise in the field of quality infrastructure for energy efficiency. Additional short-term experts will be contracted for special topics. If the technical expertise allows it, experts from the region are given preference to implement workshops and trainings in order to promote skills in the region.

It provides National Coordinators for the Management of AnGR (NC) nominated by countries with a secure means to control the entry, updating and accessing of their national data. Throughout the existence of DAD-IS, population data have been lacking for many breeds. This information is critical for guiding the national management of AnGR and the calculation of SDG Indicator 2.5.2 (SDG = Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 2.5.2 = Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction), for which AGA is the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) focal point. As of March 2018, across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 67 percent of local breeds are classified as of unknown risk status, 26 percent as at risk, and 7 percent as not at risk of extinction. The main reason for the data gap is lack of population data on country level. Livestock censuses, if carried out at all, are expensive and thus not sufficiently frequent relative to the annual SDG reporting. Moreover, they usually do not provide information on breed level. Therefore, countries need cost efficient solutions allowing them to estimate regularly the population sizes of their AnGR.

The project will introduce a containerised, stand-alone solar technology package consisting of a hundred percent off-grid cooling and drying system among mariculture farmers. Mariculture is becoming increasingly important in Kenya as natural fish stocks (e.g. tilapia in Lake Victoria) shrink. Farmers on the coast of Kenya currently produce Milkfish (Chanos chanos Forskal) in ponds. Fishermen also harvest a local sardine called Kimarawali (Stolephorus delecatulus) along the banks of rivers in the Kwale and Kilifi counties. The seasonal nature of fishing yields and the lack of suitable processing technologies force fishermen to sell their products as long as they are fresh - often below price. Unsuitable processing and handling technologies also deny access to high-end markets. The German and Kenyan partners develop a technology package to process and add value to Milkfish and Kimarawali. The technology will include the latest advances in photovoltaics (PV), phase change materials (PCM) and modelling technologies. For cooling technology, PCM cold storages or use of electrical battery, or a combination, will be optimised to guarantee stable and reliable cooling operations. Drying will be coupled to the cooling system and heat remissions will be used to supplement drying. For the production of high-quality dried fish (first-class nutritional value, texture and taste), dehydration takes place through optimised temperature and humidity control. The fishermen are trained in processing and quality assurance.

2403,2403,31923.0,Nairobi,"Eastern Africa, regional",,,"The total livestock populations within Uganda and Kenya affected/threatened by Brucellosis are estimated at 30.4 million cattle, 42.3 million goats, 21.1 million sheep and 5.3 million pigs, most of which are kept by resource poor farmers. These livestock are pivotal resource providing food security, promoting livelihoods, accounting for 20 to 30% of gross domestic product, and employ about 70 to 80% of the population. Main objectives 1. Develop capacity at College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and BioSecurity (CoVAB), Makerere , and Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,  of Nairobi (UONBI) for diagnostic and typing of Brucella spp. 2. Build capacity and train local field veterinarians, local doctors and laboratory technicians to diagnose, detect and conduct surveillance of brucellosis using applied diagnostics. 3. Main Target of the German Contribution - (i) Isolation, characterization and genotyping of Brucella outbreak strains infecting wildlife, domestic ruminants and humans, (ii) determination of temporal and regional distribution of genotypes, (iii) determination of sources and routes of spread of infections. 4. Prevention by conjunctival vaccination Questions to be dealt with '1) What is the status of brucellosis in various livestock reared in the E. African regions?', '2) Correlation between outbreaks in Animals and humans.', '3) What Brucella biovars/genotypes are involved in the causation of brucellosis in livestock and humans?', '4) Efficacy of conjunctival vaccination', '5) What infrastructural/human capacities are needed for sustainable brucellosis management?', '6) Education of people on Brucellosis, Hygiene and infection risks - how to close the gaps?'.",0.10228937,2019.0,no,Nairobi,Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture

The project will introduce a containerised, stand-alone solar technology package consisting of a hundred percent off-grid cooling and drying system among mariculture farmers. Mariculture is becoming increasingly important in Kenya as natural fish stocks (e.g. tilapia in Lake Victoria) shrink. Farmers on the coast of Kenya currently produce Milkfish (Chanos chanos Forskal) in ponds. Fishermen also harvest a local sardine called Kimarawali (Stolephorus delecatulus) along the banks of rivers in the Kwale and Kilifi counties. The seasonal nature of fishing yields and the lack of suitable processing technologies force fishermen to sell their products as long as they are fresh - often below price. Unsuitable processing and handling technologies also deny access to high-end markets. The German and Kenyan partners develop a technology package to process and add value to Milkfish and Kimarawali. The technology will include the latest advances in photovoltaics (PV), phase change materials (PCM) and modelling technologies. For cooling technology, PCM cold storages or use of electrical battery, or a combination, will be optimised to guarantee stable and reliable cooling operations. Drying will be coupled to the cooling system and heat remissions will be used to supplement drying. For the production of high-quality dried fish (first-class nutritional value, texture and taste), dehydration takes place through optimised temperature and humidity control. The fishermen are trained in processing and quality assurance. Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE (Fraunhofer ISE) and Innotech cooperate with the Kenyan Industrial Research and Development Institute (KIRDI), the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) and the Mombasa  of Technology (TUM) to design, develop and transfer the proposed technology package.",0.01916231,2019.0,yes,Kwale,Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture

Water scarcity, inadequate wastewater treatment, as well as lack of access to and knowledge of technological solutions pose major challenges for India's water management. At the same time, many German actors have knowledge and specialised technologies that can make a contribution to mastering these challenges achieving sustainable goals with high environmental benefits. However, the often specialised and decentralised companies find it difficult to gain a foothold in the market. In AQUA-Hub, so called Water Innovation Hubs are being realised in two Smart Cities, Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) and Solapur (Maharashtra), and are accompanied by pilot measures of German measuring technology for water quality monitoring.The project AQUA-Hub addresses the needs of the local water sectors identified in previous projects, as well as the challenges of the German water sector to build projects, relationships and business in the Indian market. A local presence is of great importance for the relations and information exchange between German and Indian actors. Besides networking activities and the mediation of business partners, the hubs fulfil the function of project centres for the realisation of demonstration projects and increase the exposure of Indian partners with technologies  Made in Germany . The piloting of German measurement technology for water quality monitoring, as planned in the project, thus offers the opportunity to meet these needs with manageable investments and risks and to create the basis for both better data availability on site as a starting point for measures to meet environmental goals and a connecting point for subsequent technology transfer.The further development of the Water Innovation Hubs is advised by a project advisory board consisting of the main institutions of country cooperation. Additional services of the hubs are being developed to create a sustainable, financially viable and transferable format that can be used in other regions. At the same time, the technological adaptation needs of German measurement technology will be determined.

3403,3403,45761.0,Braunschweig,Ecuador,,,"Module objective - The national system of Quality Infrastructure is strengthened for the demand of services in the area of energy efficiency. Core problem - Many of the voluntary and mandatory energy efficiency standards cannot be tested in the country because the relevant testing services are not available. Due to the insufficient testing of the quality of products with reference to established standards it is impossible to test and label whether products imported or produced in Ecuador comply with national standards. Thus, products of higher quality, which are more efficient but may be more expensive to purchase, are unable to compete against cheap products.Target groups - The target group are consumers of energy, especially private households, and users of quality infrastructure services in the area of energy efficiency, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. National manufacturers of electrical household appliances also benefit from the services, as they can make use of improved services for conformity assessment in the field of energy efficiency. The national institutions of the quality infrastructure, in particular the National Metrology Institute INEN, calibration and testing laboratories, the accreditation body SAE and conformity assessment bodies serve as intermediaries.Methodological approach (including instruments) - The methodological approach consists of the project coordination in Braunschweig and the assignment of an intermittent short-term expert with international expertise in the field of quality infrastructure for energy efficiency. Additional short-term experts will be contracted for special topics. If the technical expertise allows it, experts from the region are given preference to implement workshops and trainings in order to promote skills in the region. Key outputs - The project works in four outputs - 1) Conformity assessment, 2) metrology (focussing on luxmeters, temperature, humidity), 3) cooperation within the system, and 4) sensibilization of consumers and political stakeholders.",0.12429161,2020.0,no,Braunschweig,Bundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung

At the same time, Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa and more affected by climate change than the global average. As a result of declining agricultural yields, the trend towards urbanisation is intensifying. Cities often grow unplanned, urban sprawl occurs and informal neighbourhoods often emerge. Due to high soil sealing, however, cities are particularly vulnerable to heavy rainfall events, which are becoming more frequent and more severe as a result of climate change. This increases the risk of landslides on the slopes of the country's many hills.

Deterioration in air quality is particularly measurable during the heating-intensive winter months, especially in urban areas not connected to the district heating system. In most cases, the heating systems are outdated, inefficient and characterized by high operating costs. Œ ŒThe core problem targeted by the FC module measures is the inefficient, unreliable, climate-damaging and quantitatively insufficient heat supply to households, public institutions and businesses in Pristina.

In KfW's first partner cities, for example, it is already becoming apparent that municipal utilities will have to cope with a large loss of payments from consumers. The aim of the module is therefore to strengthen Ukrainian municipal administrations. Key measures to achieve this goal are the rehabilitation and new construction of municipal infrastructure as part of microprojects.

Coal combustion in the power plants and also in individual domestic stoves is a major reason for the enormous air pollution, especially in Pristina. Approximately 75 percent of Pristina's buildings are not yet connected to the city's central district heating system and obtain heat by using coal-based electricity and by burning unsustainably sourced wood or lignite. Deterioration in air quality is particularly measurable during the heating-intensive winter months, especially in urban areas not connected to the district heating system. In most cases, the heating systems are outdated, inefficient and characterized by high operating costs. Œ ŒThe core problem targeted by the FC module measures is the inefficient, unreliable, climate-damaging and quantitatively insufficient heat supply to households, public institutions and businesses in Pristina. The FC module will provide additional heat capacities on the basis of solar thermal generation in Pristina, create the preconditions for the new district heating connection of building units through network expansion measures, and increase the efficiency of the municipal district heating company Termokos, the project executing agency, among other things through training and education measures. The overall project will make it possible to replace the outdated heat supply to building units in Pristina, which is based on fossil fuels, with modern and sustainable district heating. The direct target group of the project are approx. 38,000 residents, users and owners of buildings that will be newly connected to the district heating supply in Pristina as part of the network expansion measures and will thus benefit from a reliable, inexpensive and more environmentally friendly heat supply.

ŒGovernment Goes Solar involves the installation of distributed grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems (rooftop systems, carports and possibly ground-mounted systems) for up to 36 public institutions (Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs) with an estimated total generation capacity of 22 MWp. The high solar potential in Ghana is still untapped, but high debt and liquidity problems of state institutions in the energy sector hinder the expansion of renewable energy (RE). 50% of the sector's arrears are due to unpaid electricity bills from MDAs.

It is part of the FC-programme ' transformation to support affordable, reliable, and climate-neutral access to energy in Uganda'. Key measures to achieve the goal include promoting the construction and operation of off-grid, solar minigrids in around 130 villages. Moreover, productive use of energy shall be promoted, while predominantly targeting women-led enterprises. Thus, the GET ACCESS scheme builds on the approach and experience of the 'Pro Minigrid' project piloted by GiZ. ŒThe project executing agency is the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development of Uganda. The intervention will be implemented as a PPP measure through a tender for subsidies to private project developers for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the minigrids. As project site the four clusters in Palorinya - Maaji, Kalangala-Wakiso, Buvuma East - Buvuma West and lake Albert have been selected. These regions show growth potential in fisheries and agriculture. The realization of these potentials is to be promoted in parallel through measures aimed at strengthening the productive use of energy. Local households, companies and public institutions are the project's direct target group. About 25.000 households are to be reached.

Key challenges for the Iraqi population include housing shortages, lack of access to basic services, and lack of employment and livelihood opportunities. There is also a tense unemployment situation due to the economic impact of the conflict, fluctuating world oil prices, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both supply and demand side support is needed to strengthen the private sector in Iraq and thus make a significant contribution to long-term job creation. Œ ŒThe project aims to create medium- to long-term income-generating opportunities for IDPs, returnees, and vulnerable residents in Iraq and to revitalize the local economy. The project focuses on measures to improve employment (including vocational training, on-the-job training, job placement, business and enterprise expansion, and grants to SMEs). In addition, short-term employment measures (cash-for-work) are also financed and business-promoting infrastructure measures are implemented.

The section of road, which is important for national and regional traffic, is one of the most accident-prone in Namibia due to its high traffic volume and the lack of overtaking facilities. Currently, 91 accidents occur per year on this section. In addition to rehabilitating the current lanes, it is planned to add an overtaking lane in sections. This should allow smaller vehicles in particular to overtake slower trucks safely.
