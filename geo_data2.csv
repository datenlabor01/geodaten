ŒThe project executing agency is the Agence de Développement de l'Electrification Rurale (ADER), which is responsible for the electrification of rural regions in Madagascar. The project is part of a larger rural electrification programme of ADER and will finance and support the implementation of two of the three regional power supply systems planned for the Sava region. The project is being implemented as a public-private partnership (PPP) project, under which several hydropower plants with a total capacity of about 6 MW and the associated power supply networks are to be planned, (partly) financed, built and operated by private sector companies on the basis of 25-year concessions. Œ ŒThe central target group is the population in rural areas outside the interconnected grid of the state power utility JIRAMA, i.e. predominantly poorer sections of the population with little to no access to modern energy/electricity. The project also aims to promote local businesses and traders that contribute to the creation of employment and income opportunities for the local population. In addition, institutional and organisational support for central sector institutions is to be provided through a complementary measure. ŒFC primarily provides funds to subsidise the investment costs of the projects through the ADER. This is intended to enable electricity tariffs to be set in such a way that the electricity is affordable for end customers and the resulting income is sustainably sufficient for the concessionaires. ŒThe total cost of the project is estimated at around EUR 26 million. FC funds are to provide a financial contribution of EUR 14 million, the concessionaires are to contribute about EUR 9 million and the Malagasy state about EUR 3 million. For a planned complementary measure (BM), additional FC funds of EUR 1 million are proposed for financing.

Around 1.4 million people (approx. 70% of the population) have been living in the Gaza Strip as UNRWA-registered refugees for more than 70 years. Their living situation is characterized by the ongoing conflict situation, which repeatedly escalates violently - most recently in May 2021 and August 2022 - and the land, sea and air blockade imposed by Israel that has lasted for 16 years. In addition to the recurring escalations, the socio-economic crisis situation that has persisted for years has had an impact on the living conditions of many residents of the Gaza Strip. In view of increasing poverty, population growth, rising costs for maintenance/repairs and a simultaneous shortage of living space, the already precarious housing conditions of many Palestine refugees have deteriorated dramatically since 2014. The rehabilitation of so called ""substandard shelters"" has therefore become a priority to support vulnerable families to improve their immediate living conditions. Œ ŒThe target group of the project are vulnerable Palestinian refugees in precarious living conditions in the Gaza Strip. Families are prioritized according to their housing situation (technical/structural criteria) and based on multidimensional vulnerability criteria. In this first phase of the project, around 220 of the neediest families will be supported to comprehensively rehabilitate their residential units.

This technological term refers to a plant that treats treated wastewater to drinking water quality, which is then fed back into the city's drinking water cycle. Since the 1960s, Namibia has been a global pioneer in the use of this sophisticated technology, which already ensures up to 25% of Windhoek's drinking water supply.

Œ ŒAgainst the background of the limited capacities of the usable surface drinking water sources and the population growth of Windhoek, there is a high need for investment in the water infrastructure.

This is to be achieved through cash transfers for the poorest rural population in return for their children's school attendance and resilience building by increasing the productivity of wheat and other crops.

At the same time, Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa and more affected by climate change than the global average. As a result of declining agricultural yields, the trend towards urbanisation is intensifying. Cities often grow unplanned, urban sprawl occurs and informal neighbourhoods often emerge. Due to high soil sealing, however, cities are particularly vulnerable to heavy rainfall events, which are becoming more frequent and more severe as a result of climate change. This increases the risk of landslides on the slopes of the country's many hills. ŒAgainst this overall background, the Rwandan government is planning a sustainable and dense urban development, the  City Kigali, on a 600 ha area on Kinyinya Hill not far from the Rwandan capital. As part of a financial cooperation pilot project, a 16 ha area of this site will be developed and approximately 1,680 housing units will be built. The project serves as a blueprint for integrated, environmentally sound and climate-friendly urban development while increasing settlement density and creating affordable housing. It thus makes a concrete contribution to making Rwanda's cities climate-smart. The target group benefiting from this includes up to 7,000 citizens of Kigali.

The individual project interventions include the development and successful application of wage subsidies to secure and generate jobs in the private sector, supported by accompanying training measures for beneficiaries. A total of around 2,000 people will find employment in this way, 60% of whom should be women. The target group are primarily unemployed Palestinians or those threatened by unemployment (graduates and workers) and, above all, particularly vulnerable groups, such as young people and women, who are severely affected by unemployment and loss of income. A particular priority is the promotion of employment in especially vulnerable parts of the Palestinian Territories (Gaza Strip).

Thus, the project on the one hand aims at strengthening the quality and availability of vocational training and, on the other hand, increasing its attractiveness while at the same time facilitating access. Phase IV and V of the project are being carried out together, with the overall support amounting to EUR 29 million. In addition, the measures are to be continued with a potential sum of EUR 30 million. The program builds on existing infrastructure investments at a total of 19 vocational schools. Similar to the previous phases, the goal of the project is to increase the number of graduates with employment-relevant skills with an additional focus on women. The project includes the following components: Œ1) Investment in infrastructure and equipment at Rwandan vocational and polytechnic schools (school buildings, boarding rooms and modern equipment).

Network costs per capita are among the highest in the world. The sustainable financing of transport routes is a major challenge for the country due to this structural condition alone. The government often lacks the funds to adequately maintain the road network. ŒThe subsidised loan will be used to rehabilitate the approximately 30km section of the TR 7/1 road between Usakos and Karibib, which, at over 50 years old, is in urgent need of renewal and at the same time central to the achievement of the target under NDP 5. The section of road, which is important for national and regional traffic, is one of the most accident-prone in Namibia due to its high traffic volume and the lack of overtaking facilities. Currently, 91 accidents occur per year on this section. In addition to rehabilitating the current lanes, it is planned to add an overtaking lane in sections. This should allow smaller vehicles in particular to overtake slower trucks safely. To ensure safety, especially for the residents of the villages of Usakos and Karibib, roundabouts and speed bumps will be integrated at the village entrances. In addition, some 80 flood culverts and three bridges will be widened to better prevent flooding along the route. ŒAs in the previous phases, the contractor will also work with Namibian smaller construction companies. It is envisaged that the Namibian contractors to implement at least 25% of the total contract value.",0.0,2022.0,BMZ,yes,Usakos
